VIT'ian Laundry Pro
# 
This project develops a web-based laundry management system for hostels to eliminate confusion in the laundry process. Students and service providers have individual accounts. Students can log in to submit laundry details such as the number and type of clothes, pickup and delivery dates, service preferences (washing, ironing, hand wash, etc.), urgency level, and special instructions. Charges, including additional service fees, are transparently displayed, and students can upload photos of their clothes for tracking. The system sends alerts when laundry is ready, allows delivery confirmation, issue reporting, and maintains a complete history of past laundry records. Service providers can monitor the real-time status of all laundry, manage inventory, and plan pickups and deliveries efficiently. Hostel authorities are given oversight access to evaluate service performance, timeliness, and student satisfaction, ensuring accountability and improved service quality.
